lightmodels
===========

lightmodels is a library to manipulate models and save them in a lightweight format (JSON is used for serialization).

EMF models and RGen models can be converted to lightmodels.

Other projects permit to obtain lightmodels representation of Ruby (ruby_to_emf_parser) and Java (java_model_jrb) code, Properties (properties_lightmodels) and XML (xml_lightmodels) files.
